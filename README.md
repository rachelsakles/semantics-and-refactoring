# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor 
In the code refacttoring I was able to assing semantic elements to the HTML. This allows the person viewing the code to better understand the purpose of the element and the type of content inside. 

Instead of having repetitive "WET" code for the css, changing the ids and classes in the HTML, I was then able to combine css elements under one id or class.
